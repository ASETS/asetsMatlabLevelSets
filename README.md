### Overview of folder structure:   
*./*: Compile scripts, readme, license and todo list  
*./applications*: Contains examples of typical applications in image segmentation and analysis  
*./data*: Example data to run the applications  
*./lib*: Is created by compile.m and contains the compiled C/mex files  
*./maxflow*: asetsMaxFlow optimization code in C/mex and Matlab 
*./tutorials*: Contains available tutorials   
*./utils*: Utilities for applications and tutorials 

### Compile/Installation instructions:  
To compile the C/mex code run:
```matlab
compile.m
```
which creates the folder *./lib*. For testing purposes run any script in *./tests*.   

### Tests:  
- Matlab 2014a, 64-bit Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)  
- Matlab 2015a, 64-bit Windows 7
- Matlab 2012a, 32-bit WinXP
